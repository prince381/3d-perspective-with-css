# 3D Transformation using pure css and tilt.js

Hey there guys,
This is the source code of my CSS 3D animation effect project which was inspired by a very wonderful UI/UX designer [@MengTo](https://twitter.com/MengTo) whom I recently discovered on twitter. The result of this project is displayed in the gif below.

Libraries used in this project are tilt.js which depends heavily on jQuery.

## Project description:

* This is a responsive single page web application designed with the purpose of harnessing the power of CSS perspective property.
* The four cards above with the 3d animation effect were designed with pure CSS.
* The animation effect on the two cards at the bottom of the page were done with tilt.js that uses jQuery to give a tilting effect to elements.

#### I will like to give to a big shoutout to the source of my inspiration for this awesome project [@MengTo](https://twitter.com/MengTo) whom I found and now follow on twitter.
